FORM VALIDATION
Validating user-entered data
    Example:
        Password requirements
There are browser validations you can use in HTML
There are also server-side validations
And also things you can do with javascript, etc.
This lesson is on browser validations

"required" attribute goes inside the <input> tag
    <input type="text" name="test" id="test" required>
Not necessarily every browser will respond the same...
    ...but generally the browser will not submit the form and popup a message if a required field isn't met.

There are "minlength" and "maxlength" attributes to determine how long data should be
    <input type="text" name="test" id="test" minlength="5" maxlength="32" required>

"min" and "max" can also be used for numbers

"pattern"
Lets you define something using regular expression (regex)
This can be used to do password validation
    Like you can use regex to see if something contains uppercase letter, lowercase letter, number, and number of characters
You can also do email validation.
    e.g., does the data contain characters@characters.something

Some types have "built-in" validation
input type="email" checks if there is an @ symbol with data behind in
type="url" checks
