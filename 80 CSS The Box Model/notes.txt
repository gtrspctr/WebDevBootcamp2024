THE BOX MODEL
Everything is CSS is a box, and those boxes have properties
Everything has a box around it, even if it's not visible
Inside the box is the Content
Surrounding the content is the Padding
Surrounding the padding is the Border

Content
    If you inspect an element in Chrome, the Content area is marked by blue

Width and Height
    By default the width/height CSS property sets the content area
    but if box-sizing is set to border-box, it sets the width of the border area
    Text by default will try to wrap to match the browser window size
    But you can set the width property to tell it to be a certain size.
        div {
            width: 200px;
        }
    These properties set the area of the box, but the text inside won't
        necessarily scrunch to fit inside that box.
    It will wrap where needed, but the font size isn't going to change.
    You can see the content area easily by setting a background-color.


BORDER
The border is the box around the element.
Outside of the content area and the padding.
The most important border properties are:
    border-width
    border-color
    border-style
The border width is additive...
    Meaning if you set the element width to 200px, and then the border-width
        to 5px, the total size of the element will be 210px...
        200px + 5px + 5px (border on either side)
However, if you set the box-sizing property to border-box, that will subtract
    the size of the element so the border fits into the specified element size.
    So then even with the border, it will be 200px by 200px.

For border-style, you can do two or more settings.
    border-style: solid dashed dotted inset;
In order, this sets the top, right, bottom, then left sides.
If you do just two settings, it sets the top and sides.
If you do three, it sets the top, bottom, and sides.

Then you can also do color, width, and style for each of the sides individually
    border-left-color: red;
    border-top-style: solid;
    border-bottom-color: blue;

You can also do the width, style, and color all at the same time.
    IN THAT ORDER
    border: 10px solid blue;
You can then set individual sides after that.
    border: 10px solid blue;
    border-left-width: 15px;

border-radius will let you do rounded corners.
You can do pixels, but using % will be a percent of the length of the border
So 10% will use 10% of the total height/width.
50% is how you do a circle
