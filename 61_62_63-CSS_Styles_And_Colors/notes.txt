INCLUDING STYLES CORRECTLY
3 ways to include CSS styles:
    Inline styles
        Write your CSS directly inline on each HTML element
        Not recommended most of the time
    The <style> element
        Write your CSS styles inside of the <style> HTML element.
        This is easy but makes it impossible to share styles between documents.
        Not recommended either.
    Stylesheet
        Write your styles in a separate document.
        Reference it using the <link> element in the <head> section.
        Recommended.

Inline styles
    See: inline_styles.html
    Uses the "style" attribute.
        <h1 style="color: blue">
        <button style="background-color: green">
    Impossible to share styles between different documents
    Also would have to make the same changes to each element if you want them to look the same.

The <style> element
    See: style_element.html
    Uses the <style> element inside the <head> section.
        <head>
            <style>
                h1 {
                    color: green;
                }
                button {
                    color: red;
                    background-color: black;
                }
            </style>
        </head>

Stylesheets
    See: stylesheet.html and stylesheet.css
    The css stylsheet is a separate file.
    Referenced using <link> in the <head> section.
    Contains an "href" to the path of the .css file
    Also contains a "rel" attribute to tell it that it's a stylesheet.


COLOR AND BACKGROUND-COLOR
Colors can be represented by a bunch of different types
    name
        color: red;
    hex
        color: #00ff00;
    rgb
        color: rgb(123, 100, 99);
    hsl
        color: hsl(30, 100%, 50%);
    and more!
"color" defines text color.
"background-color" defines background color.
    button {
        color: red;
        background-color: purple;
    }
There is also "background" which will change the color.
    However, this is more powerful and does other stuff.
    If you want to just change the background color, use background-color.


COLORS
Named colors
    All browsers are supposed to recognize 140 colors by name
        "red"
        "plum"
        "blue"
        "lightskyblue"
        etc
RGB
    red green blue
    These can be added together to define a color
    Uses numbers from 0 to 255 for each one
        rgb(0, 0, 0) would be black
        rgb(255, 255, 255) would be white
        rgb(50, 75, 123) would be somewhere else, with more blue than anything else.

HEX
    Based off same color model as rgb
    Each ranges from 0-255
    Except written using hexidecimal notation
    Hexidecimal is a base-16 numbering system
    0-9, and then A-F
    0 is 0, F is 15. So the largest single-digit hex number is F.
        In decimal the largest two-digit number is 99.
        In hex, the largest two-digit number is FF. (or sort of 1515, which is weird)
    But ff is equal to 255.
    Starts with a number sign #
    In hex...
        Red would be #ff0000
        Green would be #00ff00
        Blue #0000ff
    Hex is generally used more than RGB
    If the r, g, or b value pairs are the same, you only have to write 1 digit
        So, instead of #000000, you can do just #000
        Or instead of #cc5599, you can do just #c59
        But this shouldn't dictate what colors you choose because that obviously limits the amount of colors you can use.
