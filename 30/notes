<img> The Image Embed element displays images.
Does not have a closing tag.

The src attribute is required
    <img src="picture.png">

The alt attribute holds a text description of the image, which is good practice for
accessibility and in case a picture doesn't load.
    <img src="picture.png" alt="A picture">

Can do things like "width=200px" but this is bad practice. This should be done in CSS.
