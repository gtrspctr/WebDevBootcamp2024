<ul> is for Unordered Lists, or lists with dots that are NOT numbered.
    - Item 1
    - Item 2
    - Item 3

<ol> is for Ordered Lists, or lists that are sequenced with Numbers or letters.
    1. Item 1
    2. Item 2
    3. Item 3

They both have nested elements.
These elements are <li>, or Listed Item.
    <ul>
        <li>Item 1</li>
        <li>Item 2</li>
        <li>Item 3</li>
    </ul>

Permits zero or more <li>, <script>, and <template> elements.
For now, we'll only do <li> - Ignore the others.

Inside <li> elements you can do lots of things, though.
You can do another list, making it a nested list.
    <ul>
        <li>Example 1</li>
            <ul>
                <li>abc</li>
                <li>def</li>
            </ul>
        <li>Example 2</li>
        <li>Example 3</li>
    </ul>
