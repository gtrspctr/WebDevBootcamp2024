<a> element or Anchor element.
This is how you create hyperlinks.
    <a href="https://google.com">Go to Google!</a>

You have to include the https:// part. Otherwise it just tries to go to yourhtmlfile.com/google.com
To go to another page in your website, if the file is in the same directory, simply type:
    <a href="about.html">About Me!</a>
