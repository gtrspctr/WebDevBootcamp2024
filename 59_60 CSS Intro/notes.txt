CSS
Cascading Style Sheets
A language we can use to describe the appearance of our HTML
CSS is easy to get the hang of, but overwhelming how many properties can be described

Syntax is like:
    selector {
        property: value;
    }
Examples:
    h1 {
        color: purple;
    }
    img {
        width: 100px;
        height: 200px;
    }
    Select every other text input and give it a red border:
        input[type="text"]:nth-of-type(2n) {
            border:2px solid red;
        }
