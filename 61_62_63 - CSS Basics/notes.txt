INCLUDING STYLES CORRECTLY
3 ways to include CSS styles:
    Inline styles
        Write your CSS directly inline on each HTML element
        Not recommended most of the time
    The <style> element
        Write your CSS styles inside of the <style> HTML element.
        This is easy but makes it impossible to share styles between documents.
        Not recommended either.
    Stylesheet
        Write your styles in a separate document.
        Reference it using the <link> element in the <head> section.
        Recommended.

Inline styles
    See: inline_styles.html
    Uses the "style" attribute.
        <h1 style="color: blue">
        <button style="background-color: green">
    Impossible to share styles between different documents
    Also would have to make the same changes to each element if you want them to look the same.

The <style> element
    See: style_element.html
    Uses the <style> element inside the <head> section.
        <head>
            <style>
                h1 {
                    color: green;
                }
                button {
                    color: red;
                    background-color: black;
                }
            </style>
        </head>

Stylesheets
    See: stylesheet.html and stylesheet.css
    The css stylsheet is a separate file.
    Referenced using <link> in the <head> section.
    Contains an "href" to the path of the .css file
    Also contains a "rel" attribute to tell it that it's a stylesheet.


COLOR AND BACKGROUND-COLOR
Colors can be represented by a bunch of different types
    name
        color: red;
    hex
        color: #00ff00;
    rgb
        color: rgb(123, 100, 99);
    hsl
        color: hsl(30, 100%, 50%);
    and more!
"color" defines text color.
"background-color" defines background color.
    button {
        color: red;
        background-color: purple;
    }
There is also "background" which will change the color.
    However, this is more powerful and does other stuff.
    If you want to just change the background color, use background-color.


COLORS
Named colors
    All browsers are supposed to recognize 140 colors by name
        "red"
        "plum"
        "blue"
        "lightskyblue"
        etc
RGB
    red green blue
    These can be added together to define a color
    Uses numbers from 0 to 255 for each one
        rgb(0, 0, 0) would be black
        rgb(255, 255, 255) would be white
        rgb(50, 75, 123) would be somewhere else, with more blue than anything else.

HEX
