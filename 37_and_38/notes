SEMANTIC MARKUP
"Semantic" : Relating to meaning

A lot of websites just have <div> tags and that covers everything. Each layer is a div, and that's most of what you'll see in the source code.
Semantic markup includes tags that are basically <div> tags but they contain more meaning for the reader of the code.
    Example
        <div class="example">
            <main>
                <header>
                    blah blah blah
                </header>
                <section id="intro">
                    introduction here
                </section>
                <section id="middle">
                    Some middle stuff here
                </section>
                <section id="illustration">
                    a picture here
                </section>
                <footer>
                    some more stuff here
                </footer>
            </main>
        </div>
The reason for doing this instead of divs:
    For other computers (bots, crawlers, machine-reading). Improves SEO.
    Making code more accessible for people who need to use screen readers.
    Easier to read for other developers and yourself.

SEMANTIC ELEMENTS
<main>
    Represents the dominant content of the <body> of a document
    The main content area consists of content that is directly related to or expands upon the central topic of a document, or the central functionality of an application.
    Should exclude content that is repeated across a set of documents
        Sidebars
        Navbars
        Copyright information
        Logos
        Search forms (unless the search form is the main function of the page)
<nav>
    Represents anything on the page that provides navigation links
        Menus
        Tables of contents
        Indexes
    Could be links to things on the same page or different pages
<section>
    Represents a standalone section which doesn't have a more specific semantic element to represent it.
    Typically, but not always, sections have a heading.
<article>
    Represents a self-contained composition in a document, page, application, or site.
    Intended to be independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication)
    Example:
        Forum post
        Magazine/newspaper article
        Blog entry
        A box that contains weather forecast
        A widget
        Something that is linkable or can be viewed/referenced from another site
    Should include a heading (<h1>-<h6>) as a child of the <article> element.
    When an <article> is nested, the inner element represents an article related to the outer element.
        Example:
            The comments of a blog post can be <article> elements nested in the <article> element representing the blog post.
    Author information of an <article> element can be provided using the <address> element
        Does not apply to nested <article> elements
    The publication date/time of an <article> can be described using the "datetime" attribute of a <time> element.
        There used to be a "pubdate" attribute of <time>, but this is no longer a part of the HTML5 standard.
<aside>
    Represent a portion of a document whose content is only indirectly related to the doc's main content.
    Frequently presented as sidebars or call-out boxes.
    Tangential. Could be used as a quote or detail about what the document is talking about.
<header>
    Represents introductory content.
    Will often include navigational content as well.
<footer>
    Represents bottom of the page stuff, or bottom of a section.
    Example:
        Could have page navigational links and copyright info at the bottom of a page
        Or could have author and copyright information at the bottom of an <article>.
        etc.
<time>
    Represents a specific period in time
    May include "datetime" attribute to translate dates into machine-readable format
        Allows for better search engine results or custom features such as reminders
    May represent one of the following:
        A time on a 24-hour clock
        A precise data in the Gregorian calendar (with optional time and timezone info)
        A valid time duration
    Doesn't format any text on its own. Simply makes it machine-readable.
<figure>
    Represents self-contained content, potentially with an optional caption using the <figcaption> element.
    The figure, its caption, and its contents are referenced as a single unit.
    Example:
        A picture with a caption
<abbr>
    Represents an abbreviation or acronym.
    When using an abbreviation or acronym, provide a full expansion of the term in plain text on first use, along with the <abbr> markup. This informs the user what the abbreviation means
    Then every use after that, can just use the abbreviation along with the <abbr> element.
<data>
    Links a given piece of content with a machine-readable translation
        If the content is time- or date-related, the <time> element must be used.
    Example:
        A list that displays product names but also associates each name with a product number.
            <ul>
                <li><data value='123'>Mayo</data></li>
                <li><data value='420'>Mustard</data></li>
                <li><data value='666'>Ketchup</data></li>
            </ul>
