HTML boilerplate is standard things that have to go in every html document.

    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
        <head>
            <title>
            </title>
        </head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </html>

<!DOCTYPE html>
    This is a flag that tells the browser to use the latest tools to read html.

<html>
    This is the root or top-level element of the page.
    Everything should go inside this tag.
    Permitted content:
        One <head> element and one <body> element.

<head>
    AKA the Document Metadata element.
    Contains things that don't show up on the page.
    It's more data about the page. Like <title>, references to scripts, CSS stylesheets, etc.

<title>
    Goes inside the <head> element.
    This is what the tab of the browser will say.

<body>
    Contains all of the content that will be displayed on the page.


VS Code has a shortcut that will generate boilerplate for you.
On a blank .html file, simply type "!" without quotes and hit Tab.
