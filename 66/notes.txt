CSS TEXT PROPERTIES
text-align
    alignment
font-weight
    how bold?
text-decoration
    italicized
line-height
letter-spacing
etc.

FONT SIZES
Lots of different options
We have relative and absolute units

px (pixel) is the most commonly used absolute unit.
1px is not necessarily one screen pixel.
But two things on the page that are 10px will both be the exact same size.
Not recommended on responsive websites.

FONT FAMILY
What we use to change the font
Uses fonts that the browsers know, until later when we learn how to install our own font.
font-family: arial;

A font stack is a list of fonts that you would like to use in order.
So the top one is the one you would like to use...
    But if that doesn't work, the browser will attempt to use the next on the list.
    Then the next, etc.
This is used in CSS with commas:
    font-family: arial, verdana, futura;
This also goes for types of fonts.
    So you could do: font-family: arial, sans-serif;
    Where "serif" is a type of font.
    So if your first font isn't available then it will try to use at least a sans-serif font.
