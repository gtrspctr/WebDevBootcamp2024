OPACITY AND ALPHA CHANNEL
rgba
    red
    green
    blue
    alpha
        how transparent a color is
Alpha goes from 0 to 1, not 0-255 like the other channels
Alpha also exists for hex rather than rgb.
    In that case, hex goes from:
        #00ccff
    to:
        #00ccff00  (fully transparent)
        #00ccffff  (fully solid)
    So it simply adds 2 digits to the end that go from 00 to FF.

opacity
    Governs the entire elements transparency
    Including all child elements
    Also goes from 0 to 1
