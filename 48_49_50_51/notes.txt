COMMON INPUT TYPES
The most common form element is <input>
Can do 20+ types of inputs
"type" attribute specifies what type of input to do
    Checkbox
    Text
    etc
<input> has no closing tag.
    You simply do <input [whatever other attributes here]>
"placeholder" is an attribute that shows some value you want to be in the input field


LABELS
<label>
Really important for accessibility
A label isn't just text. It ties text to the form.
    Like a checkbox. It ties the options in a list to the specific checkbox.
    Helps with screen readers.
    It also makes the text clickable, so you can click the text to check the box as well as the box itself.
In the <input> field, you should use the "id" attribute to give the input a name
Then you use <label> with the "for" attribute and you make that equal to the same name as the <input id>
    <label for="cheese">Do you like cheese?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="cheese" id="cheese">
You can actually nest the <input> inside of the label
    <label>
        Enter your username:
        <input type="text" placeholder="username here">
    </label>
    ^Then you won't need the "for" and "id".
    ^This is less common though. It's far more standard to do separate tags and link them using "for" and "id".
    The standard way will actually let you style things differently in CSS too.
    So just do it the regular way.

BUTTONS
<button>
Represents a clickable button.
Whatever text you put between the opening and closing brackets is what you'll see.
When it's inside a <form>, <button> will take you to whatever the <form action=""> is.
    So if you have <form action="/tacos">, clicking the button will take the user to /tacos.
When it's outside the form, it does nothing by default. (you can use js to make it do something.)
The "type" attribute will let you change the action
Instead of using <button>, you can use <input type="submit">
    However, in order to customize the text is you have to also include the attribute "value".
    So,
        <input type="submit" value="Click Me">
    And of course there is no closing tag.
    This is an option, but it's perhaps a bit clunkier.

THE NAME ATTRIBUTE
'name=""'
This is used with an <input> tag to dictate where the inputted data will go.
Basically, it's like a dictionary...
    The <input name=""> is a key and whatever the user enters is a value.
So when the form is submitted, it will go to the form action, plus with the input names
    <form action="tacos">
    <input name="username">
    file:///tacos?username=bob
    file:///tacos?username=bob&password=Password123
So it almost is like a query pretty much.
"name" should be used for every <input> tag
