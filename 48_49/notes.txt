COMMON INPUT TYPES
The most common form element is <input>
Can do 20+ types of inputs
"type" attribute specifies what type of input to do
    Checkbox
    Text
    etc
<input> has no closing tag.
    You simply do <input [whatever other attributes here]>
"placeholder" is an attribute that shows some value you want to be in the input field


LABELS
<label>
Really important for accessibility
A label isn't just text. It ties text to the form.
    Like a checkbox. It ties the options in a list to the specific checkbox.
    Helps with screen readers.
    It also makes the text clickable, so you can click the text to check the box as well as the box itself.
In the <input> field, you should use the "id" attribute to give the input a name
Then you use <label> with the "for" attribute and you make that equal to the same name as the <input id>
    <label for="cheese">Do you like cheese?</label>
    <input type="checkbox" name="cheese" id="cheese">
You can actually nest the <input> inside of the label
    <label>
        Enter your username:
        <input type="text" placeholder="username here">
    </label>
    ^Then you won't need the "for" and "id".
    ^This is less common though. It's far more standard to do separate tags and link them using "for" and "id".
