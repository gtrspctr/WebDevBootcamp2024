MORE INPUT TYPES
Checkbox
    <input type="checkbox">
    You want to include a <label> for sure, otherwise the user won't know what they're checking.
    You can also specify whether the box is checked by default or not
        Checked:
            <input type="checkbox" id="scales" name="scales" checked>
            <label for="scales">Scales</label>
        Unchecked:
            <input type="checkbox" id="horns" name="horns">
            <label for="horns">Horns</label>
        ^Unchecked just doesn't have the "checked" attribute.
    One example where you might want it checked is if the user already submitted the form and you load the previously submitted data.
Radio Buttons
    Similar to checkboxes but you can only select one
    There are two big differences in the code
        First, you must give all the options in the same form the same "name" attribute. This will tie them together.
        Second, when submitted, the url will simply say "?option=on". To give it the specific value, you must use the "value" attribute.
    Example:
        <form action="/radio">
            <div>
                <input type="radio" id="employed" name="employment_status" value="employed">
                <label for="employed">Employed</label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <input type="radio" id="unemployed" name="employment_status" value="unemployed">
                <label for="unemployed">Unemployed</label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <input type="radio" id="welfare" name="employment_status" value="welfare">
                <label for="welfare">Welfare</label>
            </div>
            <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
Select
    This is a dropdown menu
    This is actually two things: <select> and <option>
    <select> is where we put the "name" and "id"
    <option> goes underneath, and just has the "value"
    Can (and should) also have a <label> like the others.
    Example:
        <form action="/select">
            <div>
                <label for="pet_select">Select a pet:</label>
            </div>
            <div>
                <select name="pet_select" id="pet select">
                    <option value="" selected>--Select an option--</option>
                    <option value="dog">Dog</option>
                    <option value="cat">Cat</option>
                    <option value="iguana">Iguana</option>
                    <option value="raccoon">Raccoon</option>
                    <option value="snake">Snake</option>
                </select>
            </div>
            <button>Submit</button>
        </form>
    It's common to have the first option be a dummy with a blank value (see above example).
    The "selected" attribute will pre-select an option. (see above)
