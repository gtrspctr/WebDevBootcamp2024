HTML TABLES
Data table
2-dimensional with rows and columns
In the 90s and 2000s, tables used to be used to layout a website

<table>

<td>
Table Data Cell
A single cell in a table

<tr>
Represents a row of cells in a table

<th>
Defines a cell as header of a group of table cells

<thead>
Defines the header area of the table
Can have more than one row in the header.
    Say, if a header had multiple "sub-headers"
    City    Country         City Proper                 Metropolitan Area
                        Definition  Population      Population  Area

<tfoot>
Defines the footer area of the table
Not often used, but can be used if the bottom row of the table has like totals or averages or something that's cumulative of the main table data.

<tbody>
Defines the main body of the table (i.e., not the headers or footers)


COLSPAN & ROWSPAN
<th rowspan="1">Header 1</th>
Defines how many rows a header will take up.
Useful if you have multiple rows where some headers have sub-headers, but not others.
    Ones WITHOUT sub-headers will be rowspan="2" (or however many the total is)
    Ones WITH sub-headers will be rowspan="1"
        Or you can just not do that if you want.

<th colspan="1">Header with sub-headers</th>
Same thing as rowspan, except you define how many columns to take up with a single header.
Useful if you have multiple sub-headers under a single header.
    <th colspan="2">
    ^This means a header will take up two columns
    And then you would have the sub-headers under that
