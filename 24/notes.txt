H tags go from H1 - H6
H1 should be the top-level, and then incrementally go down from there.
    Example, starting with H1, and then indent for the next H levels
    H1 Chicken
        H2 Terminology
        H2 Etymology
        H2 Biology and habitat
            H3 Behavior
                H4 Social Behavior
                H4 Vocalizations
                H4 Crowing
                H4 Courtship
                H4 Nesting and laying behavior
            H3 Embryology
            H3 Genetics and genomics
        H2 Origin and dispersal

The H tags don't necessarily indicate size. You could use CSS to change H1 to tiny and H6 to huge. But this is improper usage.

There should only be at most ONE H1 on a page, and it should be the top-level heading.

The only time you should use H2 is if there's an H1.
The only time you should use H3 is if there's an H2.
The only time you should use H6 is if there's an H5.... and a 4 and 3 and 2 and 1.
Etc.
