FLEXBOX
Newer part of CSS
Only become standard part of browsers in the last 2-3 years.
It's a series of properties used to lay out content on our page.
    Basically just telling elements how to fit into a box.
A good example is a navbar or some form where the items are all
    in a row. As you shrink the browser window, the space gets
    smaller, and the items automatically decide how to fit
    together.
Even if you set a width/height on elements in the flexbox, one
    or both x and y will shrink to fit into the flexbox.

display: flex
    This basically enables flexbox

In flexbox there are two axises:
    Main Axis
    Cross Axis
flex-direction
    Allows to choose which direction the Main Axis goes
    Default is "row" (x / horizontal)
        flex-direction: row;
    There is also "row-reverse" which is the same axis but it
        reverses the items so they'll go right to left.
        flex-direction: row-reverse;
    Also "column" and "column-reverse"
        flex-direction: column;
        flex-direction: column-reverse;
    So, row goes left > right
    row-reverse goes right > left
    column goes up > down
    column-reverse goes down > up
