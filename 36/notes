HTML ENTITIES (or ENTITY CODES)
A way to write special characters

Starts with an ampersand and ends with a semicolon
Used to display reserved characters that would normally be invalid
    Such as lesser than / greater then brackets.
    The ampersand is also a reserved code.
        This can be used with &amp;
    In HTML, these are reserved for elements.
Or ones that are difficult to type
    Such as a copyright symbol
The browser translates the entity code and renders the correct symbol
